## Defining The Project <br>
**C.Pay**


1. **What is the project?** <br>
The C.Pay project is a project to build a Matrix bot that can hold, receive, and send cryptocurrencies conveniently and efficiently. 

For the end-user, the main benefit of using the bot would be increased privacy for crypto trading and convenience. (Along with zero transfer fees between users)

2. **What is the MVP (Minimal Viable Product)?** <br>
The minimal viable product is a bot that can allow Matrix users to (without fees*) exchange cryptocurrency with each other as well as support crypto deposits and withdraws. 

*Users would be able to send/trade crypto across their Matrix accounts free of fees. The only way you would have fees is if you withdrew from your account. (e.g. blockchain fees and a 3% bot service fee.) 

3. **What are the nice to haves?**
    - Increase User Privacy (More details will be explained in Usage)
    - Sleek Frontend User Interface
    - Support Multiple Cryptocurrencies


4. **When will the project be complete?** <br>
The current goal is Jan 1st, 2024, at the latest. To maximize efficiency, the project would be broken up into focused chunks for concentrated development.
